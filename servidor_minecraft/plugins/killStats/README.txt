These variables can be placed in any message within messages.yml and be replaced with the appropriate data where applicable.
%victim.name% - The victims name

These variables are only applicable within the "TS_X" messages.
Example "TS_Chat_Format"
%stats.playername% - Shows the playername
%stats.value% - Shows how many kills/deaths etc they player has
%stats.position% - Shows the rank of the player
%stats.currentpage% - Shows the page that is being viewed
%stats.maxpage% - Shows the max number of pages
%stats.lastupdate% - Shows how many minutes ago the top stats were updated

This variable is used in the '/ks rank' command and on signs.

%ranking%

"AntiBoost_Time_Limit" is measured in minutes.
"Top_Stats_Update" is measured in minutes. It is best not to make this a small time limit.
If you update stats on your server every 2 minutes, your putting alot of strain on the server, its best to wait a while.

This is the best explanation of the Anti-Boost feature of this plugin I can give.
The "Anti_Boost_Time_Limit" means that the player "bob" cannot kill the player "john" more than "AntiBoost_Max_Killing" within "AntiBoost_Time_Limit". 
If player "bob" does kill "john" more than he is suppose to, he is flagged for boosting and killing "john" again will not increase his kills or killstreak.
Nor will in increase the death count of "john".

The following messages can be disabled by simply putting "disable" as the message in messages.yml

Startover_Cooldown:
When a player issues command "/ks startover" they are asked in chat to confirm they want to start over.
If they do no answer within the given time limit, their request is cancelled and their stats are not reset.
